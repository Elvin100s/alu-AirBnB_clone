## Description
This project is a simplified clone of AirBnB, implemented as part of the ALU Software Engineering curriculum. The goal is to build a complete web application that mimics the basic functionality of AirBnB.

## Project Phases
1. Command Interpreter (Console)
2. Web Static
3. MySQL storage
4. Web framework templating
5. RESTful API
6. Web dynamic

Once the command interpreter is running, you can use these commands:

- create <class> : Creates a new instance of the specified class
- show <class> <id> : Shows the string representation of an instance
- destroy <class> <id> : Deletes an instance
- all or all <class> : Shows all instances or instances of a specific class
- update <class> <id> <attribute> <value> : Updates an instance's attribute
